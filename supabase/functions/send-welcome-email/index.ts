Welcome to ${neighborhoodName} on NeighborhoodOS! 

You're officially part of the neighborhood now. No turning back. (Just kidding - you can leave anytime, but we hope you won't want to.)

Here's how to make the most of your new digital neighborhood:

üè† **Explore your neighborhood**: Check out what's happening around you
${homeLink}

ü§ù **Share your skills**: Let neighbors know what you're good at (even if it's just making excellent grilled cheese)
${skillsLink}

üéâ **Create your first event**: Host something simple and fun. Here are some low-effort ideas:
   - "Coffee on my porch" (bring your own mug)
   - "Dog meetup at the park" (humans welcome too)
   - "Neighborhood walk" (walking optional, chatting required)

${createEventLink}

That's it! No 47-step tutorials or complicated setup. Just neighbors being neighborly.
